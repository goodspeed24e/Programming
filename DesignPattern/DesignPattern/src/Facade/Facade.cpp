// Purpose.  Facade design pattern demo.
// 
// Discussion.  Structuring a system into subsystems helps reduce
// complexity.  A common design goal is to minimize the communication and
// dependencies between subsystems.  One way to achieve this goal is to
// introduce a "facade" object that provides a single, simplified
// interface to the many, potentially complex, individual interfaces
// within the subsystem.  In this example, the "subsystem" for responding
// to a networking service request has been modeled, and a facade
// (FacilitiesFacade) interposed.  The facade "hides" the twisted and
// bizarre choreography necessary to satisfy even the most basic of
// requests.  All the user of the facade object has to do is make one or
// two phone calls a week for 5 months, and a completed service request
// results.
