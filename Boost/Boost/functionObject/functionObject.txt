This chapter, which deals with function objects, could have easily been 
named 'Functions of higher order' as well. This actually refers to functions
that can be passed to or returned from other functions. Functions of higher 
order are implemented as function objects in C++ thus, the original title 
still makes sense.

Throughout this chapter, several Boost C++ Libraries dealing with function
objects are presented. While Boost.Bind replaces the well-known 
std::bind1st() and std::bind2nd() functions from the C++ standard,
Boost.Function provides a class to encapsulate function pointers. 
Finally, Boost.Lambda introduces a way of creating anonymous functions.
