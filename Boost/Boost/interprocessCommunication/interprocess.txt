Interprocess communication describes mechanisms to exchange data between 
different applications running on the same computer. This does not include 
network communication though. If data is required to be exchanged between 
applications running on different computers connected via network, take a 
look at Chapter 7, Asynchronous Input and Output which covers the 
Boost.Asio library.

This chapter presents the Boost.Interprocess library that contains numerous 
classes providing an abstract layer for operating system specific 
interprocess communication interfaces. Even though the concepts of 
interprocess communication are closely related between different 
operating systems, the interfaces can vary greatly. Boost.Interprocess 
allows a platform independent access to these functions from C++.

While Boost.Asio can be used for exchanging data between applications 
running on the same computer as well, the performance using 
Boost.Interprocess is usually better. Boost.Interprocess actually accesses 
operating system functions optimized for the data exchange between 
applications running on the same computer and thus should be the first 
choice whenever data exchange without a network is required.
