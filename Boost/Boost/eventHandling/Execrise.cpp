/*
Create a program by defining a class named button which represents a 
clickable button within a graphical user interface. Add two methods a
dd_handler() and remove_handler(), both expecting a function name as a 
parameter, to the class. If a click() method is called, the registered 
functions should be executed sequentially.

Test your code by creating an instance of the button class and writing a 
message to the standard output stream from within the event handler. Call
the click() function to simulate a mouse click on the button.
