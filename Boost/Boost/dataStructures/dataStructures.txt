For many Boost C++ Libraries, the definition of a container does not apply 
and thus have not been presented in Chapter 13, Containers. They rather 
define other data structures introduced in this chapter. For example, 
boost::tuple extends the C++ data type std::pair to allow storing not only 
two but rather an arbitrary number of values.

Besides boost::tuple, this chapter covers the classes boost::any and 
boost::variant allowing to store values of different data types. 
Variables of type boost::any behave just like variables of typeless 
programming languages which can store any information. Variables of type 
boost::variant on the other hand store information of predetermined data 
types and thus are similar to a union.
